It allows for setting up expectations and verifying that the correct repository methods were called with the expected parameters.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `GetProductionEventByRequestIDFunc`: Function to simulate getting a production event by request ID.\n- `SaveProductionEventFunc`: Function to simulate saving a production event.\n- `GetReservationFunc`: Function to simulate getting a reservation by ID.\n- `GetReservationsFunc`: Function to simulate getting multiple reservations.\n- `GetReservationByRequestIDFunc`: Function to simulate getting a reservation by request ID.\n- `UpdateReservationFunc`: Function to simulate updating a reservation.\n- `SaveReservationFunc`: Function to simulate saving a reservation.\n- `GetProductFunc`: Function to simulate getting a product by SKU.\n- `SaveProductFunc`: Function to simulate saving a product.\n- `GetProductInventoryFunc`: Function to simulate getting product inventory by SKU.\n- `GetAllProductInventoryFunc`: Function to simulate getting all product inventory.\n- `SaveProductInventoryFunc`: Function to simulate saving product inventory.\n- `BeginTransactionFunc`: Function to simulate beginning a new database transaction.\n- `CallWatcher`: Embedded struct from `testutil` package to keep track of method calls for verification.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewMockRepo() *MockRepo`\n\nCreates a new instance of `MockRepo` with default function implementations that do nothing but can be overridden.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `MockRepo` with default no-op function implementations." }] }
