It implements the `Queue` interface, allowing it to be used as a substitute for the actual queue implementation during tests. It includes two functions, `PublishInventoryFunc` and `PublishReservationFunc`, which are meant to simulate the behavior of publishing inventory updates and reservations to a queue. Additionally, it embeds `testutil.CallWatcher` to keep track of the calls made to its methods, which is useful for verifying that the expected interactions with the queue are occurring during tests.\n\n### queue/mocks.go\n```golang\ntype MockQueue struct {\n\tPublishInventoryFunc   func(ctx context.Context, productInventory inventory.ProductInventory) error\n\tPublishReservationFunc func(ctx context.Context, reservation inventory.Reservation) error\n\ttestutil.CallWatcher\n}\n```"}]}

Inside this function, the `PublishInventoryFunc` and `PublishReservationFunc` are initialized with default implementations that simply return `nil`, indicating no error. This means that out of the box, the mock will not simulate any errors when its methods are called. It also initializes a new `CallWatcher` from the `testutil` package, which is used to track method invocations for later inspection during tests.\n\n### queue/mocks.go\n```golang\nfunc NewMockQueue() *MockQueue {\n\treturn &MockQueue{\n\t\tPublishInventoryFunc: func(ctx context.Context, productInventory inventory.ProductInventory) error {\n\t\t\treturn nil\n\t\t},\n\t\tPublishReservationFunc: func(ctx context.Context, reservation inventory.Reservation) error {\n\t\t\treturn nil\n\t\t},\n\t\tCallWatcher: *testutil.NewCallWatcher(),\n\t}\n}\n```"}]}

When this method is called, it first uses the embedded `CallWatcher` to record the call along with its context and the `productInventory` argument. This is useful for verifying that the method was called as expected during tests. After recording the call, it then delegates the actual work to the `PublishInventoryFunc`, which is a field on the `MockQueue` struct that can be set to any function matching its signature. This allows test writers to customize the behavior of the mock as needed for different test scenarios.\n\n### queue/mocks.go\n```golang\nfunc (m *MockQueue) PublishInventory(ctx context.Context, productInventory inventory.ProductInventory) error {\n\tm.AddCall(ctx, productInventory)\n\treturn m.PublishInventoryFunc(ctx, productInventory)\n}\n```"}]}
