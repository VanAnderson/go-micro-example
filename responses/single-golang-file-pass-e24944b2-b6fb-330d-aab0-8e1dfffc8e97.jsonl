For each test case, it sends a request with the `Origin` header set to the test case's origin, and then checks the response's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to see if it matches the expected value (`want`). If the actual value (`got`) does not match the expected value, the test fails with an error message. \n\n### api_test.go\n```golang\nfunc TestCorsConfig(t *testing.T) {\n\t// ...
