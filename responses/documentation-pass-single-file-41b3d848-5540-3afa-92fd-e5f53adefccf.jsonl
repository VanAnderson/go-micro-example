It uses reflection to iterate over the fields of a struct and replaces sensitive string fields with asterisks and sensitive numeric fields with zero. It is recursive for nested structs.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `o` (interface{}): The object to be scrubbed. It should be a pointer to a struct with fields that may be tagged as sensitive.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- This function does not return any value.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```go\ntype User struct {\n    Username string\n    Password string `sensitive:\"true\"`\n}\n\nuser := User{Username: \"johndoe\", Password: \"secret\"}\nScrub(&user)\n// After scrubbing, user.Password would be \"******\"\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The function logs a warning if it encounters a field marked as sensitive but with an unrecognized type.\n- It only operates on exported fields of a struct due to the nature of reflection in Go.\n" }] }
