The test defines a `TestObj` struct with both sensitive and non-sensitive fields, initializes an instance with specific values, and then checks if `Scrub` modifies the sensitive fields to a predefined obfuscated state while leaving non-sensitive fields unchanged.\n\n### api_test/util_test.go\n```golang\nfunc TestScrub(t *testing.T) {\n\ttests := []struct {\n\t\tinput TestObj\n\t\twant  TestObj\n\t}{\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tinput: TestObj{PlainText: \"plaintext\", SensText: \"abc\", PlainInt: 123, SensInt: 123, PlainFloat: 1.23, SensFloat: 1.23},\n\t\t\twant:  TestObj{PlainText: \"plaintext\", SensText: \"******\", PlainInt: 123, SensInt: 0, PlainFloat: 1.23, SensFloat: 0.00},\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\n\tfor _, test := range tests {\n\t\tapi.Scrub(&test.input)\n\t\texpect(test.input, test.want, t)\n\t}\n}\n```\n"}]}
