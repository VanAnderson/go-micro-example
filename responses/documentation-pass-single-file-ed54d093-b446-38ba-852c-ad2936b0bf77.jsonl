It also handles running migrations if configured to do so. The function constructs a connection string, parses it into a pool configuration, and attempts to connect to the database, retrying if the initial connection fails.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (context.Context): The context to control the lifetime of the database connection.\n- `cfg` (*config.Config): The configuration object containing database settings.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `*pgxpool.Pool`: A pointer to the connection pool created for the database.\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during the connection process, or `nil` if no error occurred.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```go\npool, err := ConnectDb(ctx, cfg)\nif err != nil {\n    // Handle error\n}\n// Use pool\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The function will log and retry the connection process if it fails initially.\n- It applies database migration settings based on the configuration provided." }] }
