However, in this case, the method does not modify the `http.ResponseWriter` or use the `*http.Request`. Instead, it calls the `Scrub` function on the `EnvResponse` receiver (`er`). The `Scrub` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely responsible for removing or obfuscating sensitive information from the `EnvResponse` before it is sent to the client. The method then returns `nil`, indicating no error occurred during the rendering process.\n\n### api/environmentdto.go\n```golang\nfunc (er *EnvResponse) Render(_ http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) error {\n\tScrub(er)\n\treturn nil\n}\n```"}]}
