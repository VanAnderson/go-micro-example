It contains both sensitive and non-sensitive fields to verify that sensitive information is appropriately scrubbed.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `PlainText`: A string field not marked as sensitive. It is used for testing non-sensitive data handling.\n- `SensText`: A string field marked as sensitive. It is used for testing sensitive data scrubbing.\n- `PlainInt`: An integer field not marked as sensitive. It is used for testing non-sensitive data handling.\n- `SensInt`: An integer field marked as sensitive. It is used for testing sensitive data scrubbing.\n- `PlainFloat`: A float32 field not marked as sensitive.

It checks if the sensitive fields are replaced with asterisks or zero values as expected.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `t` (*testing.T): The test handler to report errors during the test execution.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```go\nfunc TestScrub(t *testing.T) {\n    // Test cases are defined and executed here\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The function defines a slice of test cases with input `TestObj` instances and expected `TestObj` instances after scrubbing.\n- It iterates over each test case, applies the `Scrub` function, and uses the `expect` function to assert the equality of the actual and expected `TestObj` instances." }] }
