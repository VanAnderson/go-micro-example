It is used to configure routes and handle user creation through the associated `UserService`.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `service`: The `UserService` used for handling user-related operations.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewUserApi(service UserService) *UserApi`\n\nCreates a new instance of `UserApi`. It initializes the struct with the given `UserService`.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `service` (UserService): The service that will handle the user operations.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `UserApi` with the `service` field initialized.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `ConfigureRouter(r chi.Router)`\n\nConfigures the router for the user API endpoints.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `r` (chi.Router): The router to configure.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. It configures the router directly.\n\n#### `Create(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`\n\nHandles the HTTP POST request to create a new user.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `w` (http.ResponseWriter): The response writer to write the HTTP response to.\n- `r` (*http.Request): The HTTP request containing the user data.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. It writes the response directly to the `http.ResponseWriter`.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The `Create` method uses the `render.Bind` function to bind the request data to a `CreateUserRequestDto` struct.\n- It logs errors and renders them to the HTTP response using the `Render` function.\n- It delegates the user creation to the `UserService` provided during the construction of `UserApi`.
