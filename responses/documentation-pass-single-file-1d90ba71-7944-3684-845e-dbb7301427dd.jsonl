It tracks the name of the function being measured and the start time of the operation.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `funcName`: The name of the function for which metrics are being collected. It is used for labeling metrics in Prometheus.\n- `start`: The start time of the database operation. It is used to calculate the latency.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `StartMetric(funcName string) *Metric`\n\nCreates a new instance of `Metric`. It initializes the struct with the given function name and the current time.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `funcName` (string): The name of the function for which to start the metric.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `Metric` with fields initialized.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `Complete(err error)`\n\nFinalizes the metric collection by recording the error (if any) and the operation latency.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `err` (error): The error that occurred during the database operation, if any.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. The method updates Prometheus metrics with the collected data." }] }

In the `db` package of the go-micro-example codebase, the `init` function is used to register the Prometheus metrics collectors for database latency, volume, and errors.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- None.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. The function does not return a value but registers the metrics collectors with Prometheus.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The `init` function is called only once when the package is imported, and it is used to perform setup tasks such as registering metrics collectors in this case." }] }
