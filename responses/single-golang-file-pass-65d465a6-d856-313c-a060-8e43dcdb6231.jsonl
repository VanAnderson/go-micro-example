It implements the `user.Repo` interface by providing mock implementations for the `Create`, `Get`, `Update`, and `Delete` methods. Each method corresponds to a CRUD operation on user entities and uses function fields (`CreateFunc`, `GetFunc`, `UpdateFunc`, `DeleteFunc`) to define the behavior of the mock. These function fields can be customized for different test scenarios. Additionally, it embeds a `CallWatcher` from the `testutil` package to keep track of method calls for assertions during testing.\n\n### usrrepo/mocks.go\n```golang\npackage usrrepo\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\n\t\"github.com/sksmith/go-micro-example/core\"\n\t\"github.com/sksmith/go-micro-example/core/user\"\n\t\"github.com/sksmith/go-micro-example/testutil\"\n)\n\ntype MockRepo struct {\n\tCreateFunc func(ctx context.Context, user *user.User, options ...core.UpdateOptions) error\n\tGetFunc    func(ctx context.Context, username string, options ...core.QueryOptions) (user.User, error)\n\tUpdateFunc func(ctx context.Context, user *user.User, options ...core.UpdateOptions) error\n\tDeleteFunc func(ctx context.Context, username string, options ...core.UpdateOptions) error\n\t*testutil.CallWatcher\n}\n\n// ... rest of the struct methods ...\n```\n"}]}

It first uses the `AddCall` method from the embedded `CallWatcher` to record the invocation of the `Create` method along with its parameters. This is useful for verifying that the method was called correctly during tests. Then, it calls the `CreateFunc`, which is a field of type `func` that can be set to any function matching the signature.
