It helps in verifying that certain functions are invoked the expected number of times.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `functionCalls`: A map where the keys are function names and the values are slices of slices of interface{} representing the arguments passed to the function calls.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewCallWatcher() *CallWatcher`\n\nCreates a new instance of `CallWatcher`. It initializes the struct with an empty map to track function calls.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `CallWatcher` with `functionCalls` initialized as an empty map.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `VerifyCount(funcName string, want int, t *testing.T)`\n\nChecks if the number of times a function named `funcName` has been called matches the expected count `want`. It reports an error to the test if the counts do not match.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `funcName` (string): The name of the function to check.\n- `want` (int): The expected number of times the function should have been called.\n- `t` (*testing.T): The test handler to report errors to.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. It reports directly to the test log.\n\n#### `GetCall(funcName string) [][]interface{}`\n\nRetrieves the slice of argument slices for the function named `funcName`.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `funcName` (string): The name of the function to retrieve calls for.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `[][]interface{}`: A slice of argument slices for each call made to the function.\n\n#### `GetCallCount(funcName string) int`\n\nReturns the number of times the function named `funcName` has been called.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `funcName` (string): The name of the function to count calls for.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `int`: The number of calls made to the function.\n\n#### `AddCall(args ...interface{})`\n\nRecords a function call by adding the provided arguments `args` to the `functionCalls` map under the appropriate function name.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `args` (...interface{}): The arguments passed to the function call being recorded.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. It updates the `functionCalls` map with the new call information.\n\n#### `ConfigLogging()`\n\nConfigures the global logger settings for the application. It sets the logger to output to the console and sets the global log level to Trace.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None. It configures the logger settings globally." }] }
