It tests various origins to see if they are allowed or disallowed according to the CORS policy.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `t` (*testing.T): The test handler to report test failures and errors.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- This function does not return any value. It uses the testing framework to report the outcomes of the tests.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```go\nfunc TestCorsConfig(t *testing.T) {\n    // ... test setup and execution ...\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The function defines a table of test cases with different origin URLs and the expected 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header values.\n- It uses the `httptest` package to create a test server and the `http` package to make requests to that server.\n- The function asserts that the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header from the response matches the expected value for each test case.\n"}]}
