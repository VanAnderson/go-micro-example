It is implemented by types that need to handle reservation operations such as creating, retrieving, and subscribing to reservation updates.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `Reserve(ctx context.Context, rr inventory.ReservationRequest) (inventory.Reservation, error)`\n\nReserves inventory based on the provided reservation request.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (context.Context): The context for the operation.\n- `rr` (inventory.ReservationRequest): The reservation request containing details for the reservation.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `inventory.Reservation`: The reservation details if successful.\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during the reservation process, or `nil` if no error occurred.\n\n#### `GetReservations(ctx context.Context, options inventory.GetReservationsOptions, limit, offset int) ([]inventory.Reservation, error)`\n\nRetrieves a list of reservations based on the provided options, limit, and offset.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (context.Context): The context for the operation.\n- `options` (inventory.GetReservationsOptions): Filtering options for retrieving reservations.\n- `limit` (int): The maximum number of reservations to retrieve.\n- `offset` (int): The offset from which to start retrieving reservations.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `[]inventory.Reservation`: A slice of reservations.\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during retrieval, or `nil` if no error occurred.\n\n#### `GetReservation(ctx context.Context, ID uint64) (inventory.Reservation, error)`\n\nRetrieves a single reservation by its ID.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (context.Context): The context for the operation.\n- `ID` (uint64): The unique identifier of the reservation to retrieve.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `inventory.Reservation`: The reservation details if found.\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during retrieval, or `nil` if no error occurred.\n\n#### `SubscribeReservations(ch chan<- inventory.Reservation) (id inventory.ReservationsSubID)`\n\nSubscribes to reservation updates, sending them to the provided channel.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ch` (chan<- inventory.Reservation): The channel to which reservation updates will be sent.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `id` (inventory.ReservationsSubID): A subscription ID used for unsubscribing.\n\n#### `UnsubscribeReservations(id inventory.ReservationsSubID)`\n\nUnsubscribes from reservation updates using the provided subscription ID.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `id` (inventory.ReservationsSubID): The subscription ID to unsubscribe from reservation updates.\n"}]}

It is used to interact with the reservation service and provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, and subscribing to inventory reservations.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `service`: The `ReservationService` that this API will interact with to perform reservation operations.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewReservationApi(service ReservationService) *ReservationApi`\n\nCreates a new instance of `ReservationApi`. It initializes the API with the given reservation service.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `service` (ReservationService): The service that will handle the reservation operations.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `ReservationApi` with the service field initialized.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `ConfigureRouter(r chi.Router)`\n\nConfigures the HTTP router for the reservation endpoints.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `r` (chi.Router): The router to configure.\n\n#### `Subscribe(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`\n\nHandles the WebSocket subscription for reservation updates.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `w` (http.ResponseWriter): The HTTP response writer.\n- `r` (*http.Request): The HTTP request.\n\n#### `Get(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`\n\nRetrieves a single reservation and writes it to the response.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `w` (http.ResponseWriter): The HTTP response writer.\n- `r` (*http.Request): The HTTP request containing the reservation context.\n\n#### `Create(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`\n\nCreates a new reservation based on the request data.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `w` (http.ResponseWriter): The HTTP response writer.\n- `r` (*http.Request): The HTTP request containing the reservation request data.\n\n#### `Cancel(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`\n\nCancels a reservation. (Currently not implemented)\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `w` (http.ResponseWriter): The HTTP response writer.\n- `r` (*http.Request): The HTTP request containing the reservation ID.\n\n#### `ReservationCtx(next http.Handler) http.Handler`\n\nMiddleware that extracts the reservation ID from the URL and loads the reservation from the service.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `next` (http.Handler): The next handler in the chain.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `http.Handler`: The HTTP handler that will handle the request with reservation context.\n\n#### `List(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`\n\nLists reservations based on query parameters and writes them to the response.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `w` (http.ResponseWriter): The HTTP response writer.\n- `r` (*http.Request): The HTTP request containing pagination and filtering parameters.\n"}]}
