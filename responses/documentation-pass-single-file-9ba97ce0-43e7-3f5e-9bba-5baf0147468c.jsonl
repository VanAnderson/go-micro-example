It is used to prepare the product inventory data for the HTTP response.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `ProductInventory`: Embeds the `inventory.ProductInventory` struct which contains the inventory data.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewProductResponse(product inventory.ProductInventory) *ProductResponse`\n\nCreates a new instance of `ProductResponse`. It initializes the struct with the given `inventory.ProductInventory`.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `product` (inventory.ProductInventory): The product inventory data to be included in the response.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `ProductResponse` with `ProductInventory` initialized.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `Render(_ http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) error`\n\nPerforms pre-processing before a response is marshaled and sent across the wire.
