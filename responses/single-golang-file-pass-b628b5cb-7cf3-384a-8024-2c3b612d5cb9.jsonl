If the `UserService` returns an error, it logs the error and responds with an internal server error to the client. Otherwise, it successfully creates the user without returning any specific data to the client.\n\n### api/userapi.go\n```golang\nfunc (a *UserApi) Create(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\tdata := &CreateUserRequestDto{}\n\tif err := render.Bind(r, data); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Err(err).Send()\n\t\tRender(w, r, ErrInvalidRequest(err))\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t_, err := a.service.Create(r.Context(), *data.CreateUserRequest)\n\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Err(err).Send()\n\t\tRender(w, r, ErrInternalServer)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n}\n```\nThis method encapsulates the logic for creating a user through the API, including error handling and response generation."}]}
