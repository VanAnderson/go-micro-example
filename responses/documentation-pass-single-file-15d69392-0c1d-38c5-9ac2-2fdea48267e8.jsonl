It includes methods to simulate inventory management operations such as producing items, creating products, and managing inventory subscriptions.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `ProduceFunc`: A function to simulate the production of a product.\n- `CreateProductFunc`: A function to simulate the creation of a product.\n- `GetProductFunc`: A function to simulate retrieving a product by SKU.\n- `GetAllProductInventoryFunc`: A function to simulate retrieving all product inventory with pagination.\n- `GetProductInventoryFunc`: A function to simulate retrieving inventory for a specific product by SKU.\n- `SubscribeInventoryFunc`: A function to simulate subscribing to inventory updates.\n- `UnsubscribeInventoryFunc`: A function to simulate unsubscribing from inventory updates.\n- `*testutil.CallWatcher`: A field from an external package to track calls to the mock's methods.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewMockInventoryService() *MockInventoryService`\n\nCreates a new instance of `MockInventoryService`. It initializes the struct with default no-op implementations of its methods.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `MockInventoryService` with default method implementations.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `Produce(ctx context.Context, product Product, event ProductionRequest) error`\n\nSimulates the production of a product.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (context.Context): The context for the operation.\n- `product` (Product): The product to be produced.\n- `event` (ProductionRequest): The production event information.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during the operation, or `nil` if no error occurred.\n\n(Additional methods follow the same documentation format as `Produce`, with appropriate parameter and return type descriptions.)"}]}
