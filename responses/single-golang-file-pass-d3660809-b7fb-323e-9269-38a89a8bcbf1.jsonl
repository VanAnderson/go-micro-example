It loads the default configuration using `config.LoadDefaults()`.\n2. It creates a new instance of `EnvApi` with the loaded configuration.\n3. It initializes a new router using `chi.NewRouter()`.\n4. The `EnvApi` instance is then configured with the router using `envApi.ConfigureRouter(r)`.\n5. A test HTTP server is created with the configured router.\n6. A GET request is made to the root URL of the test server.\n7. The response is unmarshaled into a `config.Config` struct.\n8. Finally, the test asserts that the `AppName` in the response matches the `AppName` in the loaded configuration.\n\nHere is the code snippet from the file:\n\n### environmentapi_test.go\n```golang\nfunc TestGetEnvironment(t *testing.T) {\n\tcfg := config.LoadDefaults()\n\tenvApi := api.NewEnvApi(cfg)\n\tr := chi.NewRouter()\n\tenvApi.ConfigureRouter(r)\n\n\tts := httptest.NewServer(r)\n\tdefer ts.Close()\n\n\tres, err := http.Get(ts.URL + \"/\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tt.Fatal(err)\n\t}\n\n\tgot := &config.Config{}\n\ttestutil.Unmarshal(res, got, t)\n\n\tif got.AppName != cfg.AppName {\n\t\tt.Errorf(\"unexpected app name got=[%v] want=[%v]\", got, cfg.AppName)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis test ensures that the environment API is returning the correct application name as part of its configuration." }] }
