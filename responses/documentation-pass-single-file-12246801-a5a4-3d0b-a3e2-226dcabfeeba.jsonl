It is used to provide the configuration data in response to an environment-related request.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `Config`: The embedded `config.Config` struct. It contains the configuration data for the application.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewEnvResponse(c config.Config) *EnvResponse`\n\nCreates a new instance of `EnvResponse`. It initializes the struct with the given configuration.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `c` (config.Config): The application configuration data used to initialize the `EnvResponse`.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `EnvResponse` with the `Config` field initialized.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `Render(_ http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) error`\n\nPrepares the `EnvResponse` for rendering, typically by scrubbing sensitive information. It conforms to the `Render` method required by some middleware or response handling.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- None\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `error`: Always returns `nil` as it currently does not perform any operations that can fail." }] }
