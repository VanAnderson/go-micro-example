It simplifies the creation of user objects with specific attributes such as username, password hash, and admin status.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `username` (string): The username of the user to be created.\n- `password` (string): The password hash for the user. In a test context, this can be any arbitrary string as it represents the hashed password.\n- `isAdmin` (bool): A boolean flag indicating whether the user has administrative privileges.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `user.User`: A new user object with the provided username, hashed password, and admin status." }] }
