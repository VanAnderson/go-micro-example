It allows setting up custom behaviors for the `PublishInventory` and `PublishReservation` methods using function fields and tracks the calls made to these methods.\n\n**Fields:**\n\n- `PublishInventoryFunc`: A function that simulates publishing inventory information to a queue. It takes a `context.Context` and `inventory.ProductInventory` as parameters and returns an error.\n- `PublishReservationFunc`: A function that simulates publishing reservation information to a queue. It takes a `context.Context` and `inventory.Reservation` as parameters and returns an error.\n- `CallWatcher`: Embedded struct from `testutil` package that tracks the calls made to the mock methods.\n\n**Constructors:**\n\n#### `NewMockQueue() *MockQueue`\n\nCreates a new instance of `MockQueue`. It initializes the struct with default no-op functions for `PublishInventoryFunc` and `PublishReservationFunc` and a new `CallWatcher`.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- A pointer to a newly allocated `MockQueue` with fields initialized.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n#### `PublishInventory(ctx context.Context, productInventory inventory.ProductInventory) error`\n\nCalls the `PublishInventoryFunc` with the provided context and product inventory, and records the call using `CallWatcher`.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (`context.Context`): The context for the operation.\n- `productInventory` (`inventory.ProductInventory`): The product inventory information to be published.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during the operation, or `nil` if no error occurred.\n\n#### `PublishReservation(ctx context.Context, reservation inventory.Reservation) error`\n\nCalls the `PublishReservationFunc` with the provided context and reservation, and records the call using `CallWatcher`.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (`context.Context`): The context for the operation.\n- `reservation` (`inventory.Reservation`): The reservation information to be published.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `error`: Any error that occurred during the operation, or `nil` if no error occurred." }] }
