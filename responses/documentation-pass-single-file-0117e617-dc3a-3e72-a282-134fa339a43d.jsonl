It is used to revert changes in the event of an error during a transactional operation.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `ctx` (context.Context): The context to carry out the rollback operation.\n- `tx` (core.Transaction): The transaction to roll back.\n- `err` (error): The error that triggered the rollback.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- If the transaction (`tx`) is `nil`, the function returns immediately.\n- If the rollback operation itself encounters an error, a warning log is generated using zerolog."}]}
