These fields can be assigned functions that define the behavior of the mock when the method is called. Additionally, it embeds a `CallWatcher` from the `testutil` package to track the calls made to the mock methods, which is useful for verifying that the correct methods were called during testing.\n\n### invrepo/mocks.go\n```golang\npackage invrepo\n\nimport (\n\t// ...\n)\n\ntype MockRepo struct {\n\t// Function fields corresponding to repository methods\n\t// ...\n\t*testutil.CallWatcher\n}\n\n// Mock methods implementations\n// ...\n\nfunc NewMockRepo() *MockRepo {\n\t// Returns a new instance of MockRepo with default mock implementations\n\t// ...\n}\n```"}]}
